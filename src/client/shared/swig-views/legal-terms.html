        </h3>
        <p>
            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Plate and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may
            only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Plate, or by the posting by Plate
            of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access
            to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict
            of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be
            the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. Except for claims for injunctive or
            equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court
            without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance
            with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by
            three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Knoxville, Tennessee,
            in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action
            or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. If any part of this Agreement
            is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the
            remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of
            this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent
            breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to
            be bound by, its terms and conditions; Plate may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This
            Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
